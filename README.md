# Personal Website — Web Development Capstone

## 🌐 Project Overview
This project is a multi-page **personal website** built as part of my Web Development Capstone.  
It demonstrates my ability to design, structure, and style modern web pages using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**.

The website includes the following pages:
- **Home:** Introduces me and showcases my hobbies (Grid layout).
- **Education:** Lists my academic background (Float + Position layout).
- **Weekly Schedule:** Displays my class timetable (Flexbox layout).
- **Contact:** Provides a contact form and call link (Bootstrap-enhanced layout).
- **Questionnaire:** Collects user feedback through forms.

Each page uses different layout systems and a **unified sticky navigation bar** for a cohesive user experience.

- Implemented three CSS layout techniques:
  - **Grid** (Home page)
  - **Flexbox** (Weekly Schedule)
  - **Float + Position** (Education)
- Added a **Photo Gallery** on the Home page with responsive media queries.
- Enhanced the Contact page using **Bootstrap 5** components and utilities.
- Integrated a **sticky navigation bar** with hover and active link effects.
- Deployed the site to **GitHub Pages** for public access.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Website
This project serves as my **personal portfolio and learning showcase**.  
It highlights my web design skills, technical understanding of layout systems, and my ability to use frameworks like Bootstrap.  
The site can also act as a foundation for my future personal or professional portfolio.

## 🚀 Deployment
**Live Website:** [https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name](https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name)

**Steps Taken:**
1. Added all project files (`.html`, `style.css`, images, etc.) to a GitHub repository.
2. Pushed the updated version on top of the previous Capstone repo (without deleting history).
3. Enabled **GitHub Pages** under the repository’s settings.
4. Deployed the site using the `main` branch and verified the live link.

## 💬 Feedback & Improvements
I plan to:
- Add dark mode support.
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, contrast).
- Expand the gallery with JavaScript interactivity.
- Collect user feedback to refine the design further.
